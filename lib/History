### PyDrizzle Revision Changes
Version 5.0.17 (22-June-2004) WJH
      - Added 'getDGEOArrays' to Exposure class to read in distortion
        correction images and return them as numarray objects.  If none
        are specified, then returns empty 2x2 arrays.
      - Updated interfaces to 'tblot' and 'tdriz' to use distortion image
        arrays, _pxg and _pyg.
      - Updated drizzle source code to support all interpolation kernels
        for blot, except spline3.
      - Reorganized all drizzle source code to work with STSDAS V3.3 
        code, and support STSDAS interface code as well.
      - Implemented 'osfn' interpretation of input filename to Exposure
        to avoid problems with building 'coeffs' filename when input
        name starts with './'.
      - Build coeffs filename based on last occurance of '.' in filename
        instead of first to avoid problems with names starting with './'. 

Version 5.0.16 (18-June-2004) WJH
      - Added 'prodonly' as an input parameter to PyDrizzle to control
        how the ASN table gets interpreted.  This was needed to support
        MultiDrizzle operation in the pipeline.
      - Updated 'xytosky' functionality work and be consistent with 
        STSDAS PyDrizzle.

Version 5.0.15 (8-June-2004) WJH
      - Added support for use of 'fillval' parameter with callable drizzle.
        The 'fillval' member of the parlist now gets stored as a string,
        with None being translated to 'INDEF', and 'INDEF' being the default
        to not apply any fill values. (8-June-2004) 
      - Implemented output context images. 
      - Implemented update of output headers to report Drizzle parameters
        (ala STSDAS Drizzle).
      - Fixed problems with reporting the wrong EXPTIME keyword values for
        output product headers, along with wrong EXPSTART and EXPEND values 
        for single and full product cases.
      - Added 'getLTime' and 'getDate' functions to 'fileutil'.
      - Updated 'openImage' to make copies of GEIS images when provided a
        FITSNAME for the copy.  It will also open the FITS copy preferentially
        over any GEIS image name provided, if the copy has already been made.
      - If a value of None is provided to 'findFile', it will return False/no
        instaed of crashing.
      - Added 'write', 'savecopy', and 'restoreWCS' methods to WCSObject in 
        support of new 'makewcs' module.
      - Added 'version' and 'driz_version' to ParList in 'buildPars' to 
        support adding that information as keywords to output headers.
      - Corrected DitherProduct's 'getExptime' method to work with the 
        member's product's exptime values to correctly compute the total 
        value and range.
  

Version 5.0.14 (1-June-2004) WJH
      - Updated 'openImage' to work with GEIS images in update, by allowing
        the user to force of copy to a multi-extension FITS file and use that
        for the update.  This required a new parameter 'force' to be added.
      - Added 'update' and 'savecopy' methods to WCSObject class.  These 
        methods write out new values to the header and save the old values
        as new keywords, respectively. Used by 'makeWCS'.
      - Added 'CTYPE' as attributes to WCSObject.

Version 5.0.13 (27-May-2004) WJH
      - Filter values of 'N/A' (for SBC) are now treated as valid values,
        rather than getting set to 'None', so that row selection from IDCTAB
        can succeed.  
      - Made sure that only when orient or pscale are different from 
        original WCS values will the WCS CD matrix get updated in 'updateWCS'.
        
Version 5.0.12 (18-May-2004) WJH
      - Fixed interface to 'resetPars' to include 'pixfrac','kernel', and 
        'units' as input parameters.
      - Revised 'resetPars' to only UPDATE the parlist, not create a complete
        new version.  This avoids deleting all the additions made to the 
        parlist by external programs (like MultiDrizzle).
Version 5.0.11 (17-May-2004) WJH
      - Added 'getFilterNames' to 'fileutil' to provide a unified interface
        for extracting the filter names from the input image headers.  This
        can then be used by MultiDrizzle to get the same results.  Modified 
        Exposure class and ObsGeometry class to not pass keyword names around,
        but use this function instead.
      - Fixed residual rotation and scaling problems for datasets with
        large (>50 pix) delta shifts from ASN files.  This now produces
        shift residuals less than the measurement rms.  
      - Modified 'mergeWCS' method of SkyField to recenter merging WCS, 
        then provide centered CRPIX values regardless of rotation or scaling.
        This fixed a problem with resetting psize after intial drizzling and
        shifts come out wrong.
      - Added 'pixfrac', 'kernel' and 'units' as user-resettable parameters in
        the 'resetPars' method.  This allows the user to reset these parameters
        without starting from scratch.

Version 5.0.9 (6-May-2004) WJH
      - Added 'filters' attribute to Exposure class, for access from parlist
        plist['exposure']. This string contains the names of the filters used
        for the observation.
      - Provided default behavior for running 'drizzle' when no mask/weight
        file is provided, either as a filename or a non-existant numarray
        object.  In these cases, it will use an array of all 1's and print
        a warning message.
Version 5.0.7 (27-Apr-2004) WJH
      - Revised 'run' method to accept either filenames for the 'in_mask' 
        value or a Numarray object directly. This supports direct passing
        of static_mask array as input without file I/O.        
      - Revised 'applyShifts' to rotate delta CRPIX and to not update the
        product WCS with the delta rotation when given a reference image
        for the shifts.  This corrects problems with residual shifts larger
        than the RMS and with applying twice the delta rotation.
      - Added support for DGEOFILE reference images, the distortion 
        correction images, to the Exposure class and 'buildPars'. If no
        file is provided, then blanks will be passed back to 'drizzle'.
      - Provided a default value for THETA when reading IDCTAB, so that 
        detectors without a THETA column will still process correctly.
      - Revised 'readOFFtab' in fileutil.py to use linear extrapolation for
        V2REF/V3REF values for dates newer than those in the table. It will
        still only use the first epoch values for dates older than those
        in the table, though.  Also, this fixed problems with crashing for
        dates beyond those in the table in the first place. This function
        gets called by 'upincd' as well for use with ACS and WFPC2 data.
      - Moved removal of output product from initialization to '.run' method,
        to allow for recomputation of new parameters without deleting previous
        output.
      - Expanded 'findNumExt' in drutil.py to work for WFPC2 data as well, 
        by adding support for GCOUNT as well as NEXTEND.
      - Corrected interpretation of OFFTAB table to utilize the correct row
        from the table for the chip.
      - Modified the list of files returned by buildasn._findFiles to be sorted
        by filename.
      - Completely rewrote the 'computeOffsets' method to work from
        V2REF/V3REF derived from IDCTAB/OFFTAB tables. This new method
        requires a simple parity matrix to define the relationship between
        chip X/Y and V2/V3 orientations.  However, all rotations and scaling
        is derived from IDCTAB/OFFTAB and not hard-coded in the classes, like
        WFPC2 had it.
      - Reversed the signs of the delta shifts for the output frame to be 
        consistent with those used for the input frame. 

      
Version 5.0.6 (1-Mar-2004) WJH
      #####
      Incorporated revisions for STSDAS Version 4.6 into Version 5.0.
      #####
      - Removed 'close' method, and simply closes all file-handles upon
        finishing computing the drizzle parameters.  Also, modified the
        run method to open/close the inputs as needed. 
      - Removed use of the PARITY dictionaries, as they were no longer 
        necessary given the use of 'wcsfit' to compute the offsets between
        chips.
      - Implemented 'WBACKWCS' algorithm in 'applyAsnShifts' to properly
        convert shifts in undistorted frame to each distorted input WCS.
        The WBACKWCS algorithm replaces the need to use the '.invert()'
        method of the model, and provides a fully general solution without
        iteration.
      - Added iteration of 'undistortWCS' and 'buildMetachip' to 'buildProduct'
        so that the final product will be built using the same offsets as
        'drizzle' uses.
      - Corrected the 'recenter()' method in the WCSObject class to provide
        a fully general solution for shifting the reference position of a
        WCS from off-center to the center of the frame, including orientation
        and plate scale changes.  This replaces the 'TROLL' function used
        before without requiring the use of the PA_V3 keyword (or any like it).
      - Reverted to using shifts computed solely from 'wcsfit' in 'buildPars'.
      - Revised 'drutil.wcsfit' to accept an ObsGeometry class as input
        rather than a full Observation class.
      - SkyField init() now extracts ra,dec,orient, and psize from input WCS.
      - The 'mergeWCS()' method was modified to compute rotated output sizes,
        instead of just scaling the input size.
      - Removed offsets in 'GeometryModel.convert()' so that coeffs are shifted
        by 1 (by default) to match usage by 'drizzle'. Also removed offsets from
        'drutil.getRange()' as well.
      - Implemented 'wtraxy()' in ObsGeometry class to support 'WBACKWCS'
      - Revised 'undistortWCS' to match results from 'drizzle'.
      - WCSObject class updated to report value of '.orient' derived from CD
        matrix regardless of value of ORIENTAT in header, while preserving 
        header value in '.orientat'.
      - Changed IRAF parameter 'clean' to be used only '.run'.
      
Version 5.0.5 (5-Feb-2004) WJH
      - Modified 'outputimage' to work with GEIS template images to 
        support WFPC2.
      - Added 'shift_fr', 'shift_un', and 'in_un' as parameters to 
        callable drizzle to support different plate scales for each
        chip's shifts (as in WFPC2).

Version 5.0.4 (30-Jan-2004) WJH
      #####
      - split out Exposure class into it's own module: exposure.py 
      - moved 'combin' and 'factorial' to drutil.py
      - moved 'buildRootname' and 'buildNewRootname' from drutil to fileutil
      #####
      - Added 'update' and 'memmap' parameters to PyDrizzle class to control
        use of memory-mapping and use of copies of inputs.  Revised 
        'getHeaderHandle' and 'closeHandle' to make copies of input file
        when 'update == copy' and restore the original upon closing.
      - corrected 'applyAsnShift' so that rotations are applied, not dropped
      - removed offset of 1 from output size in 'transformMetachip'
        and from 'mergeWCS'
      - corrected problem with overwriting reference WCS when using 'mergeWCS'
        in 'buildPars' by revising 'mergeWCS' and adding a new parameter 
        'overwrite=no'.
      - Updated 'help' docstring to include use of 'resetPars' and 'help()'.
      - impelemented output WCS from callable drizzle and use those values
        to update the output image header.
      - revised 'resetPars' to accept either a SkyField object or a 
        WCSObject, and added 'convertWCS' and 'updateWCS' to 'drutil' to support
        this new feature.
      - Generalized 'buildNewRootname' to accept user list of extensions to use
        when matching to input filename.
      - modified 'fileutil.copyFile' to use 'shutil.copy2'
      - added 'recenter' method to WCSObject class and use it to insure that
        input WCS is centered when fitting against the reference WCS in 'wcsfit'
      - Modified call to 'drizzle' to use WCS returned from drizzle for updating
        output image header.  
       
Version 5.0.3 (15-Jan-2004) WJH
      - Created 'buildMaskName' in 'buildmask.py' and used this in
        'addMembers' to pass along to the Exposure class for input images.
      - Modified DQPars class to only initialize/use Tk in the 'edit()' 
        method.  Initializing a DQPars class no longer fires up Tk.
      - Modified 'outputimage' to create output images as HDUList then use
        'writeto()' methods.  
      - Added 'extver' ID as input to the Exposure class, and removed 
        computation of this from within Exposure class.  Also, revised 
        Exposure class to only open a 'in_mask' file if created by 
        buildMask prior to calling Exposure.  This allows outside programs
        to generate a mask file and pass back the view to it to Exposure as 
        needed for use by 'drizzle' and 'blot'.
      - Added 'try...finally' block in PyDrizzle class to insure that no 
        matter what happens, all filehandles get closed, especially upon 
        an error.

Version 5.0beta (5-Jan-2004) WJH
    #####    
    ### Removed all dependecies on IRAF/PyRAF.
    #####
      - Replaced the IRAF versions of 'drizzle' and 'blot' with 
        direct Python callable versions which accept numarray 
        objects as input.
      - Removed all references to GEIS products: goutdata,goutweight,
        goutcontext,goutsingle,goutsweight,goutscontext. Also removed
        'convertSingleGeisToFits'.
      - Added 'image_handle' and 'image_extn' to Pattern class, and added
        'close' method to close all open 'image_handle' instances.  The
        'image_handle' is the readonly,memmap PyFITS object for each input
        observation, while 'image_extn' records the extension name/number
        for the given Exposure.  
      - Added 'handle' parameter to fileutil.getHeader and fileutil.getKeyword
        to allow direct access to already opened PyFITS object, if available.
      - Modified 'outputimage' to write out SCI,WHT,CTX numarray arrays
        to FITS files, and do it so that the numarray objects can be re-used
        as necessary by the callable drizzle/blot for new outputs. 
      
Version 5.0alpha (7-Nov-2003) WJH
      - Revised boolean comparisons to not include '== yes/no' to make
        use under Python 2.3 work. 
      - Added 'import buildproduct' to support conversion from GEIS products
        FITS products when using IRAF's drizzle.
      - Added 'dqpars' IRAF interface along with PSETs for each instrument:
        ACS, WFPC2, STIS, and NICMOS.  These PSETs can be modified to add
        chip specific readout values as needed.
      - Removed 'bits' as user parameter in favor of DQPars() classes to be
        called directly by PyDrizzle in the Observation classes for each 
        instrument.  Each instrument's class will open the shelve file
        and retrieve the bit setting specified by the user.
      - Recast 'yes' and 'no' to 'True' and 'False'.
      - Added 'irafvars.py' to package to provide 'osfn' function from PyRAF.
      - modified all file and keyword access functions to rely on PyFITS
        objects or PyFITS/readgeis, like 'fileutil.getKeyword', 
        'drutil.getChipId' and 'drutil.getIDCFile' 
      - Added 'openImage' to 'fileutil.py' work with both FITS or GEIS 
        images as PyFITS objects.
      - Moved 'findNumExt', 'updateKeyword' and 'getKeyword' from drutil
        to fileutil and modified them to work with PyFITS objects.
      - Added docstring to 'fileutil' to describe what general functions are
        available for use.  Also included 'help()' function to see the
        docstring more readily.
      - Started modifying 'runDrizzle' and 'runBlot' to use Python-callable
        versions of 'drizzle' and 'blot' even though they PyFITS objects
        are not used yet. 
      - Modified 'runDrizzle' and 'runBlot' to accept a single parlist entry
        as input instead of looping over all entries. 

Version 4.5c (7-Nov-2003) WJH
      - Removed 'crpix1/2' from computation of 'delta_refx/y' for use in
        'calcNewCorners' to avoid introducing offset for subarrays.  This 
        caused the 'overlap' logic to fail for small subarrays in the pipeline. 

Version 4.5b (31-Oct-2003) WJH
      - Modified 'transformMetachip' to correctly account for missing
        plate scale and orientation information from the SkyField object.
        This allows 'crj.fits' and 'asn.fits' inputs to produce the same
        output when SkyField was set, whereas before the scaling and 
        rotations were being overridden by the SkyField's defaults.
        Also corrected default to use newly computed naxis1/2 for
        range, instead of relying of ref.wcs (which may still be incomplete).
      - Revised 'mergeWCS' to account for plate scale changes due to 
        coeffs files. This corrected a problem in interpreting cubic
        coeffs correctly for WFPC2 data when rescaling the output.
      - Restored calls to 'mergeWCS' in 'buildPars'.
      - Removed overlap logic in 'buildPars' to avoid problems caused by
        miscalculation of corners for small subarrays.  The root cause still
        needs to be identified and corrected, but this allows the data to be
        drizzled.  (OPR 49698)
      - Added '1' to 'nref' values to account for offset introduced by 
        enlarging the final output size by 2 in 'getRange'.  

Version 4.5a (15-Oct-2003) WJH
      - removed extra calls to 'mergeWCS' in 'buildPars()' to allow changing
        of the plate scale to produce proper output size for the product.
      - modified iraf interface code to treat ra/dec values as numbers
        instead of strings.
      - Revised how cubic coeffs files are interpreted for WFPC2 to account
        for scale changes and rotations included in the coeffs files.  This
        needed to be implemented due to changes in how the WCS information is
        handled with the use of 'wcsfit' for computing the parameters.
      - Added 'idcdir' parameter to allow user to specify directory containing
        coeffs files.
      - Added 'idctype' as a return value for 'getIDCFile' to allow
        introspection of file to do the actual determination of the type of
        coeffs in the file ('cubic','trauger',...) despite the filename.
      - Revised call to 'runBlot' to actually pass the required plist.

Version 4.5 (16-Sept-2003) WJH
      - ADDED Support for NICMOS. Required adding NICMOSObservation class,
        updating EXTLIST in drutil to include '_cal', updating 
        PyDrizzle class to recognize '_asc' as well as '_asn' files, 
        and modifying 'readAsnTable' to recognize '-TARG' as equivalent to
        '-DTH'. 
      - Upgraded 'WCSObject' to check for WCS keywords first in SCI header,
        then in PRIMARY to support keywords which are in different locations
        for each instrument (such as 'ORIENTAT').  Also, made error message
        more explicit as to which keyword caused the failure.
      - Modified 'runDrizzle', 'runBlot' and 'runWDrizzle' to operate on
        single parlist entries at a time.  This will allow the redesigned
        version of Multidrizzle to operate more efficiently.
        
Version 4.4a (15-Sept-2003) WJH
      - Corrected problems with computing offsets when absolute shifts
        given in units of arcseconds.  This required modifying 'applyAsnShifts'
        and DitherProduct.buildMetachip and correcting errors in 
        'transformMetachip' when a SkyField object was provided to 
        (re)define the output frame.
      - SkyField method 'mergeWCS' revised to properly handled scale
        changes for output size and CRPIX position.
      - Reset the defining exposure for the offsets and Metachip center
        to be the first in the list, not the one with the smallest 
        shift from output center. 
      - Modified buildasn and updateasn to recognize 'absolute' AND
        'relative' for the specification of the non-delta shifts in 
        shiftfiles. Also updated help methods accordingly.
        
Version 4.4 (21-August-2003) WJH
      - NEW REQUIREMENT/DEPENDECY: numarray 0.6
      - Updated all calls to numarray modules to be consistent with
        numarray 0.6.  This forces PyDrizzle to REQUIRE numarray 0.6,
        as these changes will not let it work with numarray 0.5.
        
Version 4.3c (6-August-2003) WJH
      - modified DitherProduct.buildProduct to correctly account for output
        size and image shifts whether shifts are applied or not regardless
        of the order of the input images as well. The final size had to be
        corrected for the overall shift imposed by the shifts applied to
        the images (from the shiftfile/ASN table). In addition, the 
        reference position needed to be corrected for this overall shift,
        as well as the change in frame size (old to new) and the average
        value of all the input shifts. 
      - modified the handling of the 'clean' parameter in the IRAF interface
        to only run the 'clean' method when specified as 'yes'.  This prevents
        the '*single*' products from being deleted even when 'clean=no'.
      - modified 'computeCubicCoeffs' to support cubic coeffs files.
        REFDATA for STIS and WFPC2 had 'v2','v3' added as members to
        allow proper computation of v2com/v3com when using cubic coeffs
        files, and removed use of v2/v3 for computing shift zero-point.
        These changes were implemented in 'computeCubicCoeffs', STISObservation,
        and WFPC2Observation.
      - Fixed a bug in 'applyAsnShifts' which caused WFPC2 chips to be placed
        ever farther apart with larger shifts.  The chips new CRPIX values
        were being computed based on distortion reference position, not
        chip reference position. This difference needed to be taken into
        account when shifting the chips.
      - modified 'readCubicTable' in 'drutil.py' to use numarray float
        conversion for translating the ascii values from the tables.

Version 4.3b (29-July-2003) WJH
      - PyDrizzle did not correctly determine which files or extensions to
        modify when updating the value of the EXPTIME keyword.  This caused
        warning messages to be reported when finishing the processing when
        'build=no' (a case used by default in Multidrizzle).  This was fixed in
        the 'run()' method of __init__.py.

Version 4.3a (3-July-2003) WJH
      - modified 'buildmask.buildShadowMaskImage' to use 'replace=yes' as the
        default, so that new mask images will replace the old ones, rather
        than appending to them and causing problems.
        
Version 4.3 (23-June-2003) WJH
      - Added full WCSFIT usage in 'buildMetachip',in both Pattern base class
        and DitherProduct class, to rigorously compute
        offsets between members as well as change in orientation from 
        initial guess to output chip center. Also uses 'wcsutil.troll' function
        to update orientation. This allows PyDrizzle to compute the drizzle
        parameters as accurately (without skew) as WDRIZZLE.
      - Changed ALL instances of numarray objects to use double-precision
        Float64 units. 
      - Revised computation of '_c' and '_d' 
        elements in 'drutil.wcsfit' to correspond to WDRIZZLE routine. 
     ##### 
        These corrected problems with 'drutil.wcsfit' so that
        it now produces identical results as WDRIZZLE when given identical
        inputs. This error caused miscalculation of orientations between
        chips when using wcsfit.
     #####   
      - Added support for running PyDrizzle with WDRIZZLE instead of 'drizzle'
        with a new function 'runWDrizzle'.
      - Also, added 'gpar' parameters to ObsGeometry object to allow WDRIZZLE
        to account for shift corrections, when using WDRIZZLE. The
        full list of added pars: geomode='wcs', racen, deccen, orient,
        outscl, gpar_xsh, gpar_ysh, gpar_rot.
      - Corrected distortion-corrected position in geom.apply() by
        subtracting wcs.offset_x/offset_y when no coeffs are present.
      - Corrected corner positions from 'calcNewCorners' by XDELTA/YDELTA
        to put them in output reference frame for proper computation of output
        frame dimensions.
      - Switched to use of new 'calcNewCorners' in 'drutil.getRange()'
        (primarily for speed).
      - Modified code to print out ParList so that if there is no overlap
        determined by PyDrizzle, it will print 'None' instead of crashing.
      - Revised 'applyAsnShift' to actually update 'product.geometry.wcslin'
        object as well as corner['corrected'] positions with _delta_crpix
        so that buildMetachip can properly deduce output size when shifts
        are provided.
      - Revised 'convert' in ObsGeometry class to shift coeffs by additional
        1 pixel to correspond to 'align=center' convention for 'drizzle'.
      - Now updates 'self.v2com' and 'self.v3com' in 'computeCubicCoeffs' so that
        'buildMetachip' can properly deduce change in orientation using TROLL.
      - Added 'detector' attribute to Pattern class for use with PARITY matrix.
        For WFPC, this is set to 'WFPC' and new PARITY matrix was added to
        WFPCObservation to produce default orientation based on PC after
        fitting with 'wcsfit'.
       
Version 4.2final (11-June-2003) WJH
      - Built in support for 'wdrizzle': created 'runWdrizzle', and
        updated 'buildpars' to setup 'dr2gpar' pars for WDRIZZLE to use to
        account for tweakshifts corrections.
      - Update the input WCS object with the shifts provided by the user.
      - Modified computation of output WCS to not recenter, along with the
        updated input WCS, allows the WCSFIT to compute the proper shifts
        and rotations as parameters for 'drizzle'. 
      - Fixed the problem with specifying output parameters for single obs
        in 'buildpars'.  
        
Version 4.1final (6-June-2003) WJH
      - Revised 'buildDthProduct' to produce FITS-compliant MEF file using
        GEIS images as the template.  This bug prevented WFPC2 output products
        from being compliant, and therefore 'catfits' didn't see the extensions.
        Fix required starting with GEIS chip header, then appending GEIS
        primary header keywords that are not already in desired MEF PRI header.

Version 4.1final (5-June-2003) WJH
      - Corrected a problem in buildasn which resulted in subsequent runs
        of buildAsnTable (by PyDrizzle or Multidrizzle) to end up with 
        different, and many times obviously wrong, results. EXTLIST was
        a module attribute, but it was being copied and appended and this
        was remembered for the entire session.
Version 4.1 (4-June-2003)
      - Update offset between chips to include scale change due to VAFACTOR
        (__init__.py:computeCoeffs()).
      - Revised 'buildShadowMaskImage' to include any .c1h image DQ values
        if present, and removed default bitvalue of None for WFPC2 to enable
        this feature. (__init__.py:WFPCObservation.init() and 
        buildmask.py:buildShadowMaskImage())
      - Added GEIS outdata,outweight,outcontext images to those which are
        controlled by the 'save' parameter (__init__.py:run())
      - Blank lines in 'shiftfile' is now ignored rather than crashing
        (buildasn.py:readShiftFile())
      - Revised the application of VAFACTOR to add delta_x,delta_y as 
        attribute of geometry class (obsgeometry.py:applyVAFactor())
      - Modified buildDthProduct to produce multi-extension FITS files
        which pipeline can work with: ROOTNAME updated in PRIMARY, 
        TEXPTIME removed from headers, ASN_MTYP updated, drizzle cards
        appended to PRIMARY instead of SCI header, CCDCHIP keyword in 
        SCI header changed to -999, OBJECT keyword removed from PRIMARY.
        (buildproduct.py:buildDthProduct())
      - Message added to updateasn to better inform the user when an 
        input file is missing, then raises an immediate exception
        (updateasn.py:updateAsnTable())
        
Version 4.0release1 (21-May-2003)
      - Modified 'geisToFITS' to remove GEIS keywords, and FITS extension
        keywords from the output simple FITS file.  This (mostly?) avoids
        an 'hedit' error/bug where 'hedit' removes them but doesn't move
        up the data section leaving a blank FITS block after the END statement
        in the header resulting in 'shifted' output files.
        
Version 4.0release (16-May-2003)
       ***** RELEASE Version with all previous changes included. *****
      - Added 'DEFAULT_SCALE' member to defaultIDCModel in fileutil.
      - Changed readIDCFile() to not try and use IRAF osfn on non-existent 
        filename for default model case.
      - call getIDCFile() using primary extension only, instead of chip
        extension name. Also, added default value of 1 for 'nmembers' when
        less than all three extensions are present in an input image. This
        allows support for 'non-standard' HST-like observations.
            
Version 4.0 (8-May-2003)
      - NEW REQUIREMENT/DEPENDECY: readgeis.
      - NEW MODULES: buildproduct, obsgeometry

      - Updated to use 'close' method on readgeis objects to close
        memory-mapped GEIS files to avoid out-of-resource errors.
      - Added GEIS single-drizzle products to 'clean' method for removal.
      - Corrected logic to determine reference image from computed offsets
        and reversed the sign of the delta-CRVAL computed from relative
        shifts. This allowed relative shifts to be properly applied to data.
        (Corrected 14-May-2003)
      - Reversed the signs of the shifts applied to the distortion model when
        applying the VAFACTOR (velocity aberration) correction so the coeffs
        get properly corrected. Also, applying vafactor to coeffs was
        changed from division to multiplication, resulting in proper 
        correction of data based on geomap results.  (Corrected 15-May-2003)

Version 4.0beta9 (30-Apr-2003)
      - Revised the logic for converting single output's from GEIS to FITS
        to allow for multiple input chips.  Previously, as each chip was
        drizzled, it was converted to FITS overwriting the previous chip's 
        results.

Version 4.0beta8 (29-Apr-2003)
      - Fixed a bug in fileutil.readAsnTable which caused all shifts to be
        given units of 'pixels'.  
      - Modified 'applyAsnShifts' to only apply shifts to product.wcslin,
        as well as input WCS.
        This allows product.wcs to serve as default case for determining
        final output parameters so 'drizzle' will place inputs in updated
        positions relative to input header values.  
      - DitherProduct.buildMetachip changed to use 'product.wcslin' as 
        default WCS. Also, compute output size from 0 to max if min>0 to allow
        for shifts putting images off-center.
      - Implemented 'geisToFITS' in new 'buildProduct' module with 'readgeis'
        and use it to automatically convert GEIS output to FITS format when 
        finished with 'drizzle', then deletes the GEIS image immediately. 
        Thus, user never sees GEIS unless there is a problem. This required 
        using seperate names in parlist for GEIS and FITS output names.  
      - Update both EXPTIME and ORIENTAT in output SCI image.
      - Created 'obsgeometry' module to contain all of the geometry classes
        originally located in __init__ file.
      - Added default filter names for use with SBC in 'fileutil.readIDCtab'.
      - Modified 'geisTofits' to write out SIMPLE FITS file, instead
        multi-extension as dither tasks only work with SIMPLE FITS inputs.

Version 4.0beta7 (11-Apr-2003)
      - Fixed a bug in '_findRefFile' where it tried to compare non-dictionary
        entries of sdict to input file list.  This caused 'expected character
        buffer' error.
        
Version 4.0beta6 (10-Apr-2003)
      - Added support for drizzling on a single chip/group by adding a 
        new parameter: section.  The help was updated to reflect this new
        parameter, along with the IRAF interface task.

Version 4.0beta5 (10-Apr-2003)
      - Removed input parameters from 'updateShifts' to account for the
        fact that those defaults are now set by 'readShiftFile'.
      - Corrected 'readAsnTable' in 'fileutil' to insure that the 
        same units are passed along for all shifts read from the file.  
        Also, removed the code which shifted 'relative' shifts so that 
        one is at 0.,0.
      - Completely rewrote 'applyAsnShifts' in '__init__.py' to 
        handle all 6 input cases for shifts.  Also, modified 'buildProduct'
        in DitherProduct class to call this in a more general manner.

Version 4.0beta1 (7-Apr-2003)
      - NEW REQUIREMENT/DEPENDECY: readgeis.
      - NEW MODULE: buildproduct

      - Completely restructured the code to compute parameters after all 
        the default cases are computed. Also added 'resetPars' method to 
        the PyDrizzle object. Both of these support changing the output
        field specification 'on-the-fly' with the PyDrizzle object.  
      - Added the method 'transformMetachip' in the Pattern class.  It 
        performs the transformation of the default output field into
        the user-specified output field.
      - Implemented 'corners' attribute to Exposure and use them for 
        checking overlap with output field, and for computing output size.
        Also, added functions in 'drutil' to support use of the corners,
        such as 'getRotatedSize'.
      - The method 'buildProduct' in the Pattern class is overridden in
        the DitherPattern class to support 'resetPars' usage.

      - A new 'clean' method was added to the PyDrizzle object to simplify
        removal of intermediate products created by PyDrizzle and products
        created by 'drizzle' itself that may not have been combined into the
        final multi-extension FITS product. 
        ####NOTE####
        This replaces the 'clean' parameter in the PyDrizzle object.

      - Implemented support for both relative and delta shifts.  
	    The method 'applyAsnShifts' was moved to the Pattern class to
	    allow application of relative shifts and to apply all shifts
	    to the default case.
      - Updated 'buildasn' to support new ASN tables with both relative
        and delta shifts.

      - Rewrote 'buildDthProduct' to work with either FITS output or 
        GEIS output from PyDrizzle, and uses 'readgeis' for combining
        the GEIS products into a single output product.  Moved this
        function to its own module: buildproduct. 

      - Incorporated Richard's 'invert' method in the ObsGeometry class to 
        support coordinate transformation from an undistorted to the original
        'raw' distorted frame. 

      - Added 'flprc' calls immediately after each run of 'drizzle' and 'blot'
        to allow IRAF to better handle the memory usage.

      - Implemented drutil.wcsfit and drutil.fitlin to perform linear
        fits between a distorted image's WCS and an undistorted output WCS.
        This is used to correctly compute the output rotations, especially
        in the cases of high-Declination observations.

      - Velocity aberration correction implemented as a method of ObsGeometry
        and initially called when Exposure object is initialized. This 
        method uses POSTARG*,RA_TARG, DEC_TARG keywords to deduce the
        aperture center position which this correction is centered on. 

      - Updated WCSObject method 'updateWCS' to update overall size and
        default CRPIX position when the plate scale changes.
        
      - Revised IRAF parameter interface to support new clean method, 
        and to allow single-drizzle option as well.

Version 3.4a (13-Feb-2003)
    (OPR 47600)
      - This version implements changes to select the rows from the
        IDCTAB based on the filters used for the observation as well
        as chip and direction. Required changes to __init__.py and 
        'readIDCtab' in fileutil. 

Version 3.4 (21-Jan-2003)
    (OPR 47271)
      - Changed output drizzle products to GEIS format from FITS
      - Rewrote 'buildDthProduct' to process input GEIS drizzle products
        and use imcopy to combine into a MEF file. It also removes duplicate
        keywords from extensions. 
      - Rewrote 'getKeyword' to trim trailing '/' from values.
      - Added 'new' parameter to WCSObject to indicate whether it is 
        being created from scratch or based on an existing WCS object.
         

Version 3.3f (30-Dec-2002)
      - Included defaults for ALL drizzle parameters to avoid having
        user settings for the 'drizzle' task interfere with PyDrizzle 
        settings; specifically, 'in_un' assumed to be 'counts' but not
        explicitly set by PyDrizzle before this. 
      - Updated EXPTIME for single output products as well.
        
Version 3.3f (7-November-2002)
      - OPR 46912:
        Reset 'and' to 'or' when determining whether LTV values indicate 
        a subarray or not.  This correction took place in the ObsGeometry class.
      - Use 'buildNewRootname' to always create an output _drz.fits filename.
      - Corrected how user-specified extensions are handled in 'buildRootname'.
      
Version 3.3d (28-August-2002)
      - Fixed bug in applying offset to subarray CRPIX value; needed to base
        it on original CRPIX.
      - OPR 46600:
        Removed all calls to 'keypar' and replaced them with calls to 'hselect'.
        This eliminates problems with multiple calls to keypar stepping on each
        other as they write out the results to the par file, then read in the
        results.

Version 3.3c (21-August-2002)
      - Added explicit 'fillval' parameter to PyDrizzle and its IRAF interface.
      - Fixed syntax error in 'drutil': added colon to end of 'elif' in 
        buildRootname.

Version 3.3b (20-August-2002)
      - Revised 'asndict' in fileutil.readAsnTable to include an 'order' 
        list as a member. This provides ordered access to the members in
        the dictionary when building up the list of members, keeping the 
        parameters in the same order as listed in the ASN table.
      - The 'addMembers' method of DitherProduct was modified to use the
        ordered listing of members to keep the images straight.

      - Added checks when adding members so that when it tries to work with 
        files that have no recognizable usable inputs, it will skip that 
        entry and continue. If no inputs are recognizable, it will quit 
        at that point.
      - Revised filename checking to search for 'rootname'+'.fits'. This 
        should account for user-provided files which do not have standard
        suffixes, such as 'crj.fits'.
        
Version 3.3a (20-August-2002)
      - 'buildasn' was modified to accept a file with a list of files,
        a wild-card specification or a suffix/partial filename as input.
        In addition, a verbose mode was added to print out the list of files
        which were used to build the table. 
        An IRAF EPAR interface was also built for 'buildasn'
        
Version 3.3 (12-August-2002)
      - Updated 'buildPars' to (finally) keep PyDrizzle WCS synchronized
        with 'drizzle' product WCS for arbitrarily-specified output frames
        as well as default case.
      - Modified to work with default IDCTAB which applies NO correction at all
        when no valid IDCTAB keyword or no valid header-based coeffs file
        could be found.  This allows a user to specify 'N/A' for IDCTAB and
        still use PyDrizzle.  The 'defaultModel()' method was added
        to 'fileutil' to generate the proper set of coefficients.
      - Revised WCS output to be formatted better on printing.
      - Tested extensively using WFC, HRC datasets, including single exposures,
        dithered associations, CRJ associations, and WFC sub-array data.

Version 3.2 (1-August-2002)
      - Corrects errors in using RA/Dec set in SkyField object.
      - Adds new formatting for printing out 'parlist' dictionary
        entries for each input.
      - Added 'updateasn' to package.  This module allows a user to 
        update an existing ASN table with new shift information.
      - Changed mask file from Int16 to Int8 (for space and I/O efficiency)
      - Revised 'buildasn' to support modular creation of offsets and rotation
        columns. Also, revised IDCKEY storage in PyDrizzle as well.
      - Removed extraneous 'nchips' parameter from Exposure class.
      - Changed code so that weight and context products are not created for
        'single=yes' runs.


Version 3.1 (16-July-2002)
      - Implemented support for correct drizzling of ACS subarray 
        observations, particularly in support of polarization data.
        This revision required addition to 'wcslin' the calculation of
        naxis*, crpix* and center positions after distortion correction.
        This involved moving 'calcNewCorners' to the ObsGeometry class.
        It also involved modifying 'geometry.XYtoSky' to support subarray
        coordinates: shift them to full frame, then apply correction from
        wcslin. It also required the creation of a new method for the
        GeometryModel class, shift, to create a coeffs file for 'drizzle'
        which has been shifted to match the center of the subarray. The 
        convert method will automatically call this new method if it detects
        that it is working with a sub-array. Reading the value of the 
        subarray offset from the image header (getLTV) was also moved
        to the GeometryModel class.    
        
Version 3.0a (26-June-2002)
      - Fixed a bug with running blot.  Exposure time in outsingle
        images from 'drizzle' is not correct (exptime * nchips), and
        blot used it as is.  Changed this to have PyDrizzle specify
        exptime for each chip.
      (OPR 46092)
      - Implemented a check in 'buildmask' to remove faulty inmask 
        files when they are created.  

Version 3.0  (25-June-2002)
      - Changed the import command to include 'stsdas,analysis'.
      This will allow it to be run from Python directly.
      (Used for initial build of STSDAS release)
Version 3.0  (21-June-2002)
      - Minor change to naming of blot output to correctly support
            WFPC2 chip IDs.

Version 3.0  (14-June-2002)
      (OPR 46091)
      - Implemented 'single=yes' and 'blot=yes' in .run() for PyDrizzle.
      (OPR 46093)
      - Corrected offset problems so that images are not only 
      centered in output, but output size is calculated 
      to within a pixel(in width or height) of needed size 
      regardless of what the user specifies.

      - Treats WFPC2 data XDELTA/YDELTA correctly with regard
      to offsets from center (nref). 

      - Renames coeffs and mask files based on EXTVER instead of
      chip ID.  This makes it easier for users to manually keep
      track of which files go with which extensions.

      - Copies over all 'drizzle' created keywords from 'drizzle'
      output images into the combined PyDrizzle MEF product.


Version 2.6  (12-June-2002)
      - implemented internal changes to support separate output for
        each input, along with renaming 'shifts' dictionary in PyDrizzle
        to a more appropriate 'pars'.  This also corrects a bug in 2.5a
        with creating a final output from 'drizzle' with the same name
        as the desired combined final output. This version, however,
        will NOT actually create single outputs or run blot.
        In addition, 'buildmask' was modified to delete previously
        existing mask files it finds before re-creating them.

Version 2.5a (6-June-2002)
      - Corrected WFPC2 alignment problems by manually adjusting the
        refdata for WFPCObservation class to match output from
        'wmosaic'.


Version 2.5 (31-May-2002)
      - Fixed final problems with using optional SkyField parameters
          such as RA/Dec and shape. Updated ObsGeometry.apply() to 
          accurately reflect sub-array offsets now.

Version 2.3 (30-May-2002) 
      - Output size of product correctly predicted and product
          WCS consistent with 'drizzle' product for rotated and 
          default conditions. Now correctly works with sub-arrays.

Version 2.2a  - Revised to be consistent with new numarray syntax

Version 2.2   - Reworked use of WCS to compute accurate offsets between
          observations from header.  Added 'undistortWCS' to create
          linear CD directly from distortion without scaling.
          Revised WCSObject to simplify updates of attributes and
          formatted output on prints.
          Includes new 'convert' method for working with IDCTABs
          where NORDER > 3.

Version 2.1c  - Updated ORIENTAT in SCIHDR instead of PRIHDR

Version 2.1b  - Corrected namespace bug in wcsutil, and protected against
          creating products with BSCALE and BZERO (in fileutil).

Version 2.1a  - Added separate interface to XYtoSky function in wcsutil.
          Corrected slight bug in WCSObject.xy2rd() function.
          Changed 'from - import *' to explicit 'import' calls.
          Corrected logic problem in 'drutil.buildRootname'.
          Created IRAF interface for 'xytosky' task.

Version 2.1   - Fixed bugs in use of numarray to perform XYtoSky on positions
          or arrays of positions. Also, changed import calls to
          numarray to be explicit rather than using from-import *.
          This allows the built-in methods to be used interactively.

Version 2.0   - Reorganized and revised to use PyFITS V0.6.1 with numarray
        instead of FITS v0.4.2 with Numeric. Required modifying
        'Obsgeometry.apply' and 'calcNewEdges' to work with arrays
        instead of a single X,Y tuple. Reconfigured to support
        installation into STSDAS using Python-tree. Separated out
        WCS library into a separate callable library for use by
        other tasks as well.

Version 1.4b  - Corrected a problem for WFPC2 data, not to use DETECTOR
          to try and access the groups.  Instead, use logical number.

Version 1.4a  - Fixed a bug in building parameters without a SkyField
        Automatically deletes previous product now.   

Version 1.4   - Updated Exposure class to understand subarrays and
          offsets (based on LTV keywords)
          Also, updated to rely solely on the version of 
          'drizzle' in STSDAS (since it was updated to 
          TDRIZZLE Version 2.6).
          Applies corrections provided in ASN table as well.
          Updates EXPTIME in 'drizzle' products.
          Updates EXPSTART/EXPEND in Dither product.
          Added 'build' parameter to '.run()', if set to 
          'no', will not create multi-extension FITS product.

Version 1.3f  - Worked out bugs in IRAF interface function for 
          SkyField parameters.
Version 1.3e  - SkyField object use for specifying output frame 
          finally works as intended! 
Version 1.3d - Fixes bugs in the IRAF interface to include usage
          of the SkyField object for user specified parameters
          for the output frame. Also, updates ORIENTAT in 
          primary header only in output DTH product.
Version 1.3c - Corrects total exptime in output MEF image
Version 1.3b - Fixes bugs in SkyField usage and in building the WCS for
          PyDrizzle product objects.
      In addition, 'readIDCTable' was updated to accept tables
      with either 'A'/'B' or 'CX'/'CY' coefficients column names.

Version 1.3  - This version contains the final working interface for
      user-specified SkyField and it works with the EPAR interface.
Version 1.2  - First Version with ACS, WFPC2, and STIS support
       Can use cubic,Trauger, and IDCTAB files for STIS and WFPC2
       This version also overwrites any existing output file with 
       the new dither-product file.

Version 1.1  - Added WFPC2 support.
Version 1.0b - Revised to work with PyFITS 0.4.2.
Version 1.0a - Revised to work with CALACS.
Version 1.0 - IRAF enabled version with complete drizzle
      functionality.
Version 0.5 - Revised to combine drizzle output products
      into a single multi-extension FITS file.
      Has optional keyword to PyDrizzle.run() to
      control whether the separate drizzle products
      are saved or not (default: save=no).
Version 0.4 - Revised calculation of output size to account
      for shifts by drizzle coefficients. 
Version 0.3 - Added arbitrary user rotation, output pixel size,
      kernel choice to wrapper.  Also, added automatic
      use of 'tdrizzle' if available (defaults to 'drizzle'
      V1.41 in STSDAS) and some on-line help.

Version 0.3 (27-Aug-2002) WJH
        Added 'mode' parameter to either 'replace' shifts or 'sum' them with
        existing shifts.  If in 'sum' mode, any INDEF values will be considered
        as 0., however, values of NaN/-NaN will not be updated/summed.
        
Version 0.2a (26-Aug-2002) WJH
        Revised input of 'output' parameter to recognize filenames without
        extension specification or '.fits' in filename. Defaults to using 
        either primary or 'sci,1' in that order if none are specified.
        Added verification code and somewhat more informative error messages.
        
Version 0.2 (26-Aug-2002) WJH
        Made input rootname handling more general; can
        build full filename from rootname only using 'drutil.buildRootname'.
        No longer requires extension specification.  Modified 
        'drutil.getPrimaryKeyword' to append '[0]' extension if no extension
        was recognized.
Version 0.1 WJH - Release Version
